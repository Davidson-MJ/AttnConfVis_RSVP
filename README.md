Analysis/exploration scripts for Experiment 2 (Attention and Confidence), and Experiment 3 (Attention and PAS), 
on data previously collected by James Macdonald.

A copy of the data (EEG .cnt files and Behavioural .tsv) has been uploaded here: https://osf.io/j2cah/

On your local, start with 
>convert_tsv2matlab.m 

to convert the tsv tables to matlab tables.

Then, all analysis and plotting scripts can be set, and called from 
>'Data_explore.m'

I'll work on commenting and updating anything that's unclear, just let me know!

Happy coding :)
