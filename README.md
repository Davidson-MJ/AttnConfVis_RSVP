Preprint: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.11.23.469669v1

A copy of the data (EEG .cnt files and Behavioural .tsv) has been uploaded here: https://osf.io/j2cah/

On your local, start with 
>convert_tsv2matlab.m 

to convert the tsv tables to matlab tables.

Then, all analysis and plotting scripts can be set, and called from 
>'Data_analysis_A_Beh.m'
>>'Data_analysis_B_EEG.m'

I'll work on commenting and updating anything that's unclear, just let me know!
